# pdfa-conversion

Converting PDF files to PDF/A is poorly documented and impossible to do in large batches without [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/). This contains a DEF file and a command to convert a PDF to PDF/A-2B. It is written for Mac, and uses a built-in color profile.

This might just work for myself, but others might also be running into all the myriad of options in PDF/A conversion.
